# Abstract
In this report we will look at how to use Voyant and RAWGraphs to extrapolate themes from large texts such as *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelly. Using the articles *Deformance and Interpretation* by Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann and *Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display* by Johanna Drucker, we can prove how valuable simple text analyzation tools are to the deeper and more detailed analysis of large texts. The results found show that you are able to find a theme of *Frankenstein* by using Voyant to procure word associations and count unique word formations.

# Introduction
Everyone, at one point in their life or another, has had to write a paper extrapolating from a book or article they have read in class. The topic on which the paper has its focus, however, is unique to the text, writer, and person who is requiring the paper from the writer. This tends to lead into people finding meanings and important information differently than someone else who is tasked to write that same paper. Some people might take a small phrase from their reading and run with it, but then end up running out of references to back up their thesis. 

By using a tool like Voyant, you have the ability to visually see what words are used the most and where they are located within the text. This allows you to quickly find what you want to talk about and can feel confident that you will be able to back them up with enough proof to prove your point. To further back up your argument, you can also use other graphing tools like RAWGraphs to visualize the data in other ways. 

Using *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley, we will be able to see how the larger themes of the book are able to be extrapolated using the text analyzing tool Voyant and their unique word counting and their frequency of proximity tools. The hypothesis of this paper is that at least one theme of the book *Frankenstein* will be clear when analyzed by the analytical tool Voyant and reinterpreted the data using RAWGraphs. 


# Method
## Materials
These are all done online and do not require any downloads or physical materials.

### Project Gutenberg
This is an online database that will allow you to search for any book that is in the public domain. You are not limited to only using this website if you have other ways to access the text you would like to access, but for the purpose of this experiment, this is where we will be getting the text of *Frankenstein*.

### Voyant
This is an online text analyser that will take the text you input and output statistical information about it. This will be the tool used for all of our analyses and graphs that will allow us to extrapolate themes from the text based on the word associations and unique word counts. Voyant also removes filler words like “and,” “is,” and “the,” which allows us to streamline our analysis without having to account for these words that don’t have much meaning.

### RAWGraphs
This is an online graphing tool that will allow you to input spreadsheets and other chart data to help you visualize said data. This will be used for finding other ways to show the data we have received from Voyant that is not available from that tool. We will also be using this to back up the graphs we see from Voyant and arrange them in ways that have more flexibility and originality.

## Procedure
1.	Open the Project Gutenberg website and search for the text you will be analyzing. In this case we will be using *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley.
2.	Once you find the copy of the text you will be analyzing, click the “Plain Text UTF-8” file under “Format.” This will open a .txt file without any pictures or formatting.
3.	Copy just the main text, making sure to exclude any acknowledgements, introduction, and the Project Gutenberg terms of use at the end of the text that might skew your data. For *Frankenstein*, copy from “LETTER I.” to “He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.”
4.	Paste the copied text into Voyant and click “Reveal” for the program to analyze your text.
5.	Open the Terms tool and export current data as tab separated values.
6.	Copy and paste this data into RAWGraphs.
7.	Explore the possible graphs that both Voyant and RAWGraphs have available and find the graphs you feel most comfortable using to analyze your text.
8.	Analyze how the relationships between words and their frequency inform the themes of the text.

# Results
In the bottom left of Voyant, there is a summary of the document imputed. Here it states that the text has a total of 75,199 words and 7,044 unique word forms. It also states that there are 22.8 average words per sentence and the most frequent word in the text is “man” being used 132 times. Following this, “life” was used 115 times, “father” was used 113 times, “shall” appeared 105 times, and “eyes” was used 104 times.

This curris graph shows the count of each unique word form in the inputted text. Here we can see that “man” is the largest as it was used the most, but “life” and “father” appear to be used about the same number of times.

<img src=collocatesgraph.png>

This collocates graph shows the frequency of words that appear in close proximity. The blue keywords are connected to the orange collocates or other keywords as they appear in proximity to each other. If we look to the bottom right, we can see here that “Clerval” is linked to the word “friend.” We also see that on the left, there are a lot of references to time.  

<img src=bargraph.png>

This bar graph shows the top 14 most used words in *Frankenstein*. This gives us a more accurate view than the curris graph of which words were used the most. We can see here that, although “life” and “father” were the same size in the curris graph, “life” was clearly used more than “father” was. We can also see that “day” and “felt” were used the exact same number of times.

# Discussion
Once we have reviewed the data we have received from Voyant, we can see that there are a lot of references to time and other abstract words. These are what we will focus on when looking for theme. I have already read *Frankenstein*; therefore, I know that this book discusses the themes of life, death, and creation often. This is clearly shown in the results of the two graphs we have used in the Results section of this report. We can see that there is a theme here based around what is and what isn’t. This theme can be taken further into the thoughts about what makes man human, or what connections Victor makes between life and death.

It is also interesting to note that “eyes” is one of the most used words in *Frankenstein*. The creature’s eyes are one of the few times I can recall from memory that eyes were specifically mentioned, but clearly there is something to explore about how the description of the creature’s eyes and other people’s eyes differentiate. You can also see that some of the other most used words are “mind,” “heart,” and “felt.” This can be extrapolated into a theme about the differences between emotions and logic.

The data presented by the bar graph and the curris graph only give us basic information and quantify how many times a word is used. According to Drucker, this data is limited (Drucker, 21). There is limited information to be drawn from simple statistics as wordcount. However, this does not deem this information useless. This can help us start our exploration and help us gain ideas. The correlation graph, on the other hand, is able to give us more of the information that we can use.

To further the idea of using this data for an essay or book report, I would start looking at the connections between life and death. Because *Frankenstein* deals with Victor creating the creature and creating life, there are both negative and positive connections to both words. “Life” connects to “happiness” and “new” which are both usually positive words, but it also connects to “pass” which connects to “despair.” Meanwhile “death” connects to “soon,” showing that Victor knows he is on his deathbed as he tells his story. 

Like Samuels and McGann state that, “interpretation unfolds in fractal patterns of continuities and discontinuities” (Samuels, 48), this method of analyzation opens the door to the possibility of misinterpreting what the story is actually about. Because “death” connects to “Justine” you can assume she dies, but that could turn out to not be true. In this case, that is a poor example as she is killed on trial for a murder she did not commit, but there is the possibility that without reading the entire book, you would assume that the creature was the one to kill her.
This does prove, however, that it is possible to gauge the themes of the inputted text by using Voyant, as long as you read the text for yourself alongside using it. There is beauty in context, but sometimes you can get caught up in it and forget about the big picture. This tool is extremely useful for someone to use in a way that will allow them to break down the text and gain a greater understanding of the material.
